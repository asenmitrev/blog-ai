# Discovering the Charm of Porto: A Two-Day Itinerary

Nestled along the Douro River in northern Portugal, Porto is a city steeped in history and culture, with its stunning blend of old-world charm and contemporary flair. From the labyrinthine streets of the Ribeira district to the soaring bell towers of its many churches, Porto offers a feast for the senses. Join me as we embark on a two-day journey through this enchanting city.

## Day 1: Exploring the Heart of Porto

### Morning: São Bento Railway Station and Porto Cathedral

Begin your Porto adventure at one of the most beautiful train stations in the world, São Bento Railway Station. The entrance hall is adorned with approximately 20,000 azulejos, the traditional Portuguese blue and white tiles, which depict scenes from Portugal's history. ![ são bento railway station azulejos](img/porto-img/1.png)

Enjoy a traditional Portuguese lunch at one of the many riverside restaurants. ![ ribeira district porto](img/porto-img/3.png)
