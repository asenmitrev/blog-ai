From its grand squares and medieval streets to its vibrant cultural scene and world-renowned gastronomy, Brussels is a destination that promises an unforgettable weekend. Here's how to spend two or three days in this fascinating city.

## Day 1: Grand Beginnings and Gastronomic Delights

For lunch, grab a traditional Belgian waffle from a street vendor. These aren't just any waffles; they're a heavenly treat, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, often topped with whipped cream, strawberries, or chocolate sauce. ![ belgian waffle street vendor](img/brussels-img/4.png)
