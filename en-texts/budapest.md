# A Weekend Getaway in Budapest: The Pearl of the Danube

Budapest, Hungary's capital, is a city that seamlessly blends its rich history with a vibrant, contemporary culture. Straddling the Danube River, with Buda on one side and Pest on the other, this city offers a unique experience that combines stunning architecture, relaxing thermal baths, and a nightlife that's second to none. Here's how to spend an unforgettable two or three days in Budapest.

## Day 1: Exploring Castle Hill and the Buda Side

### Morning: Buda Castle and the Castle District

Start your day early and head to the Buda side of the city. Take the funicular or walk up the hill to Buda Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The castle, which dates back to the 13th century, now houses the Hungarian National Gallery and the Budapest History Museum. Spend a couple of hours exploring the castle and enjoying the panoramic views of Pest across the river.

### Afternoon: Fisherman's Bastion and Matthias Church

After a traditional Hungarian lunch at one of the Castle District's cozy restaurants, make your way to the Fisherman's Bastion. Its fairytale turrets offer some of the best views of the city, especially the Hungarian Parliament Building across the river. Right next to the bastion is the Matthias Church, with its colorful tiled roof and Gothic architecture. Take a guided tour to fully appreciate its history and beauty.

### Evening: Dinner with a View

End your day with dinner at a restaurant overlooking the Danube. Opt for a place with outdoor seating to enjoy the illuminated views of the Chain Bridge and the Parliament. Hungarian cuisine is hearty and flavorful, so try local dishes like goulash or chicken paprikash.
