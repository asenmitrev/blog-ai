# A Weekend Getaway to Brașov: A Tale of Medieval Charm and Natural Splendor

Nestled in the heart of Romania, the city of Brașov beckons travelers with its medieval allure and the breathtaking landscapes of the Transylvanian Alps. This guide will take you through an enchanting two-day journey in Brașov, where history and nature intertwine to create an unforgettable experience.

## Day 1: Exploring the Old Town

### Morning: Council Square and the Black Church

Begin your adventure in the city's main square, Piața Sfatului, or Council Square. As the sun casts its golden hues over the pastel-colored buildings, you'll feel as though you've stepped back in time. The square is a perfect spot for a leisurely breakfast at one of the many cafes, where you can indulge in traditional Romanian pastries and a strong coffee.

After breakfast, make your way to the Black Church, the largest Gothic church in Romania. Its name comes from the darkened color of its walls, the result of a fire in the 17th century. Inside, you'll find a rich collection of Oriental rugs and a massive pipe organ that still resonates with music during concerts.

### Afternoon: Stroll Down Strada Sforii and Tampa Mountain

Post-lunch, take a short walk to Strada Sforii, one of the narrowest streets in Europe. This quirky alleyway is a remnant of Brașov's medieval past and makes for a unique photo opportunity.

Next, embark on a hike up Tampa Mountain. The trail starts near the city center and offers several routes to the top. For those looking for a more leisurely ascent, the Tampa cable car provides a scenic ride with panoramic views of the city. Once at the summit, the Hollywood-style 'Brașov' sign awaits, along with sweeping vistas of the old town and the surrounding mountains.

### Evening: Romanian Cuisine and the Rope Street

As dusk falls, head back to the old town for a hearty Romanian dinner. Savor traditional dishes like sarmale (cabbage rolls filled with meat) or polenta with cheese and sour cream at a local restaurant like 'Casa Românească'.

After dinner, take a nighttime stroll to the Rope Street, the narrowest street in Brașov, beautifully lit and creating a romantic atmosphere. It's the perfect end to your first day in this medieval city.

## Day 2: Castles and Surrounding Nature

### Morning: Bran Castle

On your second day, venture outside the city to the legendary Bran Castle, often associated with the Dracula myth. A short drive or bus ride will take you to this iconic fortress perched atop a rock. Explore the castle's many rooms and learn about its history, which is far more fascinating than the fictional tales that overshadow it.
